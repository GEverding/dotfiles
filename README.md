# My dotfiles

These are a collection of my dotfiles for Ubuntu.  

## Vim

This repository does not contain my main vim settings/plugins.  Those are kept in a fork of [@spf13's](https://github.com/spf13) [spf13-vim](https://github.com/GEverding/spf13-vim). My local vim/gvim settings and vundle settings are stored here.
